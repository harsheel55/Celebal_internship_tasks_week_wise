# Week -4: Introduction to Express.js

This week, we begin working with **Express.js**, the most popular web framework for Node.js. Youâ€™ll learn how to create robust web servers, handle routing, use middleware, and serve static and dynamic content.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

### 1. What is Express.js?
- Overview of Express.js
- Why use Express instead of core HTTP module?
- Real-world use cases

### 2. Setting Up an Express Server
- Installing Express via npm
- Creating a basic server
- Listening on a port

### 3. Routing and Express Router
- Defining GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes
- Modularizing routes using Express Router

### 4. Middleware
- What is middleware?
- Creating custom middleware
- Using built-in and third-party middleware (e.g., `express.json()`)

### 5. Handling Requests and Responses
- Accessing request data (headers, body, params)
- Sending responses (HTML, JSON, status codes)

### 6. Query Parameters and URL Parameters
- Extracting query parameters (`req.query`)
- Extracting route parameters (`req.params`)

### 7. Static Files
- Serving static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Using `express.static()` middleware

### 8. Template Engines
- What are template engines?
- Using EJS (or another templating engine) to render dynamic content
- Setting up view engines in Express

### 9. Express Router
- Splitting routes into modules
- Organizing route files
- Using `.use()` to mount route modules

## âœ… Assignment

**Goal:**  
Build a **basic web server** using Express.js.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up a new Node.js project with Express.
2. Create multiple routes (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
3. Handle query and URL parameters.
4. Serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS).
5. Use a template engine (e.g., EJS) to render at least one dynamic page.
6. Structure routes using the Express Router.

**Bonus:** Add custom middleware for logging request details.
